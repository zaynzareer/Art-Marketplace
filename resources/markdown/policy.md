# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: January 26, 2026_

This policy explains how the Crafty Art Marketplace course project ("the Project") uses information while being developed and demonstrated for academic purposes only. The Project is not intended for commercial deployment or handling real customer data.

## Information We Collect
- Basic account details: name, email address, and course affiliation provided by you or your institution.
- Course-related content: artwork uploads, listings, and messages you choose to submit for the assignment.
- Technical data: IP address, device/browser details, and usage logs captured to keep the demo functioning and debug issues.
- Cookies and local storage: used for session management and preference retention; no third‑party advertising trackers are used.

## How We Use Information
- Authenticate users and provide the core marketplace features required for the coursework.
- Support grading, feedback, and team collaboration within the class context.
- Maintain platform reliability, debug issues, and protect against abuse.
- Produce anonymized, aggregate insights for improving the assignment deliverable; no personal data is sold.

## Sharing and Disclosure
- Instructors, teaching assistants, and designated peers may access submitted content for grading or review.
- Service providers (e.g., hosting, email delivery, storage) may process data strictly to operate the Project.
- We do not sell personal information. Data is disclosed only if required by law or to protect the Project and its users.

## Data Retention
- Information is kept only for the duration of the course and a limited archive window needed for grading, backups, and evaluation.
- After the course concludes, personal data and submissions may be deleted or anonymized during scheduled cleanup.

## Security
- Reasonable technical and organizational safeguards (access controls, encryption in transit, least-privilege access) are applied. No system is perfectly secure, so please avoid uploading sensitive personal information.

## Your Choices
- You may request correction or deletion of your data while the Project is active; some data needed for grading may be retained until coursework is complete.
- You can disable cookies in your browser; core session functionality may be limited as a result.

## Academic Scope Only
This Project is a learning exercise. Do not use it for real financial transactions, production workloads, or storing sensitive data beyond the assignment requirements.
