These Terms govern your use of the Crafty Art Marketplace course project ("the Project"). By accessing the Project, you agree to these Terms. The Project exists solely for academic coursework and demonstration; it is not a production service.

## 1. Academic-Only Use
- The Project is for course learning, grading, and demonstrations. Do not use it for real commerce, payments, or storing sensitive personal data.
- Content you submit (artwork, listings, messages) may be reviewed by instructors, teaching assistants, and peers for feedback and grading.

## 2. Accounts and Conduct
- Provide accurate information and keep your credentials secure. You are responsible for activity under your account.

- Do not submit third-party content without permission.

## 4. No Real Transactions or Warranties
- Listings, orders, or payments inside the Project are simulated for learning only. No real goods, services, or money should change hands.

## 5. Privacy
- See the Privacy Policy for how information is collected and used within the academic context.

## 6. Termination
